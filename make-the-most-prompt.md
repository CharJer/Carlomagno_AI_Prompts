# 1.1. Initial prompt
```
I have this [any topic], how can I make the most of it?
```
Example Topics:
 - I bought the Red Dead Redemption 2, how can I make the most of it?
 - I have Gaming Chair, how can I make the most of it?
 - I have subscription to [any service], how can I make the most of it?
 - I read the book [book name], how can I make the most of its lessons?
 - I watched the movie [movie name], how can I make the most of it?

# 1.2. Follow-up prompt
```
Tell me more.
```

# 2. Expansion
```
Deconstruct the topic into every major component, principle, or dimension. List them, then identify which few (the critical 20%) yield the majority of the value. Explain why these are disproportionately powerful.
```

# 3. Temporal and Process
```
Think in terms of time and process. What specific preparations, in-the-moment practices, and post-engagement integrations transform superficial interaction into deep mastery? Outline the before, during, and after phases
```

# 4. Constraints and Creativity
```
Impose constraints to force creativity. How would you extract maximum value with only 10% of the usual resources? How would use differ for an absolute beginner versus a 20-year veteran? What becomes possible when you remove a supposed 'essential' element?
```

# 5. Context and Ecosystems
```
Zoom out. What surrounding ecosystems, hidden communities, unofficial tools, or adjacent skills are required for true mastery? Map the invisible network that surrounds this topic. How does optimal use change across different cultures, environments, or life circumstances?
```

# 6. Assumptions and Inversion
```
Identify the deepest assumptions about using this. Invert them. What would 'anti-mastery' look like? What taboo, controversial, or ethically gray applications reveal the boundaries of its potential? What can failures teach that successes cannot?
```

# 7. Synthesis and Emergence
```
Synthesize components from previous layers into novel combinations. What new value emerges from connecting the unconnected? Design a personal protocol that includes non-negotiable practices, adaptive triggers for different contexts, and criteria for knowing when mastery is complete.
```

# 8. Transfer
```
Extract the meta-patterns. What underlying principles here apply to seemingly unrelated domains? How does this topic reflect fundamental truths about systems, human psychology, or value creation? What can you learn here that makes you better at everything else?
```

# Optional - If it is repeating answers
```
You are summarizing established points. I need you to jump cognitive layers. Do not elaborate on what has been said. Instead, execute this specific command: [INSERT THE NEXT LAYER PROMPT FROM THE LADDER ABOVE]. Apply it directly and exclusively to the topic.
```

# Optional - Making the most and beyond
```
Move beyond the documented, conventional, and popular wisdom. Your task is to report on the undocumented folklore, the fringe experiments, the accidental discoveries, and the heretical opinions held by a passionate minority of extreme practitioners. What do they know, do, or believe that contradicts the mainstream manual?
